It is required to conduct a study to analyze gene expression data for the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) cancer type.

We have 2 files for GE data for LUSC:

 1- GE data for tissues with cancer: 'lusc-rsem-fpkm-tcga-t_paired.txt'.
 
 2- GE data for tissues in a healthy case: 'lusc-rsem-fpkm-tcga_paired.txt'.
